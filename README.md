This Javascript project also uses HTML and CSS to create a mock version of amazon.com. It has functionality for even more backend development. In checkout/paymentSummary.js, fetchPromise can be used with a person's own backend webpage. I didn't post mine, as those services aren't free. If the backend service is not working, it saves to localStorage instead.

This project uses async functions and promises.
